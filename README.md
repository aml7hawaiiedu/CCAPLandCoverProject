# CCAPLandCoverProject

# Description
The code is written in Python and is used for training a U-Net model to classify land cover types in satellite imagery. 
The code imports libraries from Google Earth Engine, TenserFlow, and Folium, and uses EE Python API to initialize an image collection. 
The code then applies a cloud mask to Landsat 8 surface reflectance images. 
The code generates a one-hot encoding representation of the land cover classification image for Hawaii obtained from the NOAA C-CAP dataset.
